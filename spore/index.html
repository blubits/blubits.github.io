            <h1 class="text-center">The Problem</h1>
            <p class="description">Air pollution is a major problem in Metro Manila. According to a 2007 World Bank report, the treatment of air pollution-related illnesses costs the Philippines P798 million a year. Lost income was estimated at P5.7 billion from air pollution-related deaths. It was also estimated that 5,000 people die prematurely due to diseases resulting from exposure to poor air quality in Metro Manila.</p>
			<p class="description">In 2003, the Department of Energy and Natural Resources, through the Environmental Management Bureau constructed a network of Air Quality Monitoring Stations. There are 17 operational stations located in Metro Manila, each costing P3 million. It was designed to analyze the air and measure air pollution within 2 kilometers of its location. Meteorological conditions that influence the behavior of air pollutants like wind speed, temperature, radiation and humidity were also measured in those stations.
