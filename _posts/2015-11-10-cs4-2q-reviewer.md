For additional resources, consult the following:

* Videos on sorting and searching by [Harvard's CS50](cs50.harvard.edu), found here:
    - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX2CYIJLwfg) for linear search
    - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5SrAga1pno) for binary search
    - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY) for bubble sort
    - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8hXR_Hvybo) for selection sort
    - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFG-XuyPYUQ) for insertion sort
* The ArrayList API can be found [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html). You need to know how to:
    - add and remove (an) item(s) to the list
    - get the index of an item
    - change the item at a certain index
    - get the size of the list
    - remove all items in the list.
* There are slides in the CS4 Facebook group, that should help =)
