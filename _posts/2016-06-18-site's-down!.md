You'll notice the site's currently down. After the longest time, I'm actually starting to add info to it again. So hooray, I guess.

The site's still under development right now, but the stuff I'm using is set. The underlying framework is [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io), which is lightweight, responsive, and flexible. I always felt the site to be too slow and flashy with MDL and stuff bogging it down - this should be an improvement.

I haven't decided if the blog, as it stands right now, will go or not - most of my work will probably fit better on Medium or Tumblr, but having a personal blog is nice if you want to push urgent stuff. Right now, though, I've changed the font to Arial (the LaTeX font is way too ugly for 2016) and changed a few colors to make it fit the rest of the upcoming site.
