That doesn't mean I can't start to use this blog. Using this more actively has been in my mind for a couple of weeks now, but my laziness only made me work on the blog CSS this weekend. You'll see the layout is pretty barebones, but it should do the work for now while I fix the rest of the blog features.

So, without further ado, welcome to my blog. Yay. =)
